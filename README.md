# Spelling Bee Live Word Stats

## Overview

This project provides **feature enhancements** for the [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) puzzle game directly on the New York Times website.

It adds real-time word counts and other statistics, making it easier to track progress and enhance the Spelling Bee experience.

You will get a compact, live-updating table (letters Ã— word lengths + totals) directly on the Spelling Bee page with a small floating menu to toggle visibility.

## Installation Instructions

There are two ways you can add this feature enhancement:

1. [Browser Extension](extension/README.md) (recommended)
1. [Tampermonkey Script](script/README.md)

## Usage

### You will automatically see real-time stats on the Spelling Bee game page.
